# Crop-Recommendation-System
Recommending Suitable crops to grow on the soil based on its temperature,pH and humidity.This can help farmers choose better option.

 Crop Recommendation System:
This project is a machine learning-based Crop Recommendation System that helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts choose the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental conditions such as soil pH, temperature, humidity.

 Features:
Predicts the best crop to grow for a given set of environmental conditions

Trained on real agricultural datasets

Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Pandas

Web interface using Flask 

Easy to use and extendable for other agricultural applications

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook (for training & EDA)

Flask (for backend API)

HTML+CSS


The model uses supervised learning algorithms such as:

SVM 

Random Forest and compares their performances
